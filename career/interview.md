## How to Answer Questions

### Tell Me About Yourself

A good interviewer should have already reviewed your resume so they shouldn't be asking you this question. If they do, then a good response responding with a clarifying question such as:

"Do you have any specific questions about my background?"

If they do, then you can simply answer those. If not, then you can move on without wasting valuable interview time. If they still insist that you tell them about yourself, then the best way to answer is by talking about things you worked on that fit the job description.


### What is your greatest weakness?

  * Pick a weakness:
    * That isn't critical to do the job you're interviewing for, e.g. "public speaking" for an engineering position.
    * That is fixable. Personality traits are not fixable.
    * That (if possible) the interviewer already knows, e.g. "lack of experience."
  * When you state your weakness, talk about what you're doing to improve it.
  * Don't try to use a bullshit strength (such as "working too hard" or "being a perfectionist").


### Why should we hire you?

### What are your strength?

Pick strengths that match the job description.

### Why do you want to work here?

### Why did you leave your previous job?

### What are your greatest accomplishments?

### Describe a difficult problem you were faced with and how handled the situation.

### Do you have any questions?

Some good questions to always ask are:

  * Do you have any concerns about my qualifications for this position?
  * Do you think I am a good fit for this position?
  * What are the next steps? (This is a good question to figure out when you expect to hear from them. If you don't hear from them in that timeframe, you can follow up without sounding pushy.)

Ask questions that show you're eager to help the company rather than what benefits the company can offer you.
